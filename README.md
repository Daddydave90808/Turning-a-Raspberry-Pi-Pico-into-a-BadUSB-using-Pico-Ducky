# Turning-a-Raspberry-Pi-Pico-into-a-BadUSB-using-Pico-Ducky
A few months ago, I converted a Raspberry Pi Pico into a BadUSB device using the Pico-Ducky project. The Pi Pico is a microcontroller that can be programmed to act like an HID device, such as a keyboard. With this in mind, I made one that could perform defined scripts as if a user had typed them onto the host computer.
